Mantis2019

This is based off the 2018BeachBlitz branch from 2018FRCRobotCode. 

Note: Due to a compatibility issue using the PathfinderOLD vendordrop, we are utilizing the old menthod of including the Pathfinder library by adding the Pathfinder-Java-1.8.jar and libpathfinderjava.so into a libs/ folder at the root of the project directory and including them in the build.gradle file.
